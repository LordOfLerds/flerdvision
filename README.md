# Flerdvision

Architecture-first repository for a **UI-native social publishing system** using normal user logins. Social platform APIs are intentionally outside the publishing path.

## Safety status

**NOT LIVE.** Final publishing is disabled by default. The repository is deliberately structured so that content arrival, routing, publication, verification and notifications are independent ports/adapters.

## Core invariant

A UI click is never treated as a successful publication. The durable chain is:

`SourceObservation -> ContentItem -> PublicationIntent -> PublishAttempt -> VerificationEvidence -> VerifiedPublication`

Every node is traceable backward to its source and forward to its targets.

## Current code

The first commit contains the canonical domain contracts and a tested state machine. Platform and Drive implementations are intentionally not yet allowed to perform irreversible actions.

```bash
npm run check
```

## Handoff

`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` define the non-negotiable invariants for any coding agent. Architecture decisions live under `docs/adr/`.
